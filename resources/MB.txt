beauty
banff and jasper national parks are among the most beautiful national parks in canada with snowcapped peaks and wildlife  the only thing that is less easy to find is the seclusion we had hoped for we got to the bottom of this in the eqe 350 4matic suvnot many places rub ones own mortality in their face quite like mountains covered by glaciers  those millenniaold unbalanced masses of ice that have shaped peaks and carved valleys in the course of the earths history and in doing so have secured themselves first place among the most powerful natural sources of erosion on the planet who are you in the face of these elemental forces that can move mountains

such questions almost force themselves on you in the canadian rockies they appear like a silhouette on the horizon when you leave calgary behind and loom up on you on the transcanada highway an elongated massif at first almost tiny then suddenly huge the highest peaks here reach just under 4000 metres not the stuff of world records but they do make for some perpetual snow cover and extensive ice fields the mountains stack up higher and higher in front of us becoming steeper and more jagged and suddenly we are in the middle of them all with the snowwhite eqe suv under the whitegrey peaks of the rockies above us an admiral blue that only alpine regions can paint in the sky like this exploring

for everyone else it serves as an iconic postcard motif and reliable source of onlyinbanff anecdotes  there is said to be a lady black bear near the golf course for example who likes to take her afternoon nap on the green atticus garant loves these stories and is generally addicted to the regions beauty you hear the water the wild animals the wind in the trees you feel the fresh air see the incredible texture of the mountains its just amazing sometimes i feel like im living in a simulation

the immaculate beauty of the place which has been repeatedly modernised in recent years always sends the brain on a mindboggling excursion for example when one of the wild wapiti deer that like to roam the town centre stops in front of a hotel chewing birch leaves you just have to pinch yourself for a moment and remind yourself that you are really watching a wild animal  and not just an extra posing for the travellers cameras
