well last month my friend alfie and i had a crazy idea we decided to cycle from the south of england to the north of scotland from lands end to john ogroats its an 874mile trip it takes ten to fourteen days but im not a fast cyclist and i want to enjoy visiting different places so we plan to ride for four weeks we will visit historic cities like bath and edinburgh cycle through the pretty countryside and visit museums and castles on the way alfie wanted to camp but id like a comfortable bed at the end of each day so we are going to stay in guest houses i hope it doesnt rain a lot but i hope its not too hot either campervan your
